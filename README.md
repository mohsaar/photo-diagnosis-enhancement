# Photo Diagnosis and Enhancement Tool 🖼️✨

This project was developed as part of a **university Digital Signal Processing course**.

It automatically detects and fixes common photo problems using classical DSP techniques without relying on deep learning.

## Features
- ✅ Noise detection and denoising
- ✅ Blur detection and sharpening
- ✅ Low contrast enhancement
- ✅ Color imbalance correction
- ✅ Overexposure and underexposure fixing
- ✅ Red-eye detection and removal
- ✅ Vignetting correction
- ✅ Oversaturation fixing

## How It Works
- Input: One or more images in a folder
- Output: Enhanced versions saved in `/output/` folder
- Tools used: `Python`, `OpenCV`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`

## Running the Project
```bash
python main.py
